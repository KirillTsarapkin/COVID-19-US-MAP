# COVID-19-US-MAP
Choropleth map of COVID-19

Simple choropleth map of the COVID-19 virus using the Plotly Library in Python, listing number of reported cases, deaths and recoveries. 
I used Johns Hopkins University as my data source, when you run this python program, it will automatically fetch the latest .csv file on https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports .
